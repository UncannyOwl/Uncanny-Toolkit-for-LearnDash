The Uncanny LearnDash Toolkit adds the following features to your LearnDash site:

* **[Front End Login](https://www.uncannyowl.com/knowledge-base/front-end-login/?utm_medium=ldtoolkitreadme)**: Replace the default WordPress login form with a clean, modern login form that you can add to any branded page. Also supports front end password reset with a custom email. User verification can be enabled to require registrations be approved by an administrator.
* **[Hide Admin Bar](https://www.uncannyowl.com/knowledge-base/hide-admin-bar/?utm_medium=ldtoolkitreadme)**: Hide the WordPress admin bar for specific user roles.
* **[LearnDash Resume Button](https://www.uncannyowl.com/knowledge-base/learndash-resume/?utm_medium=ldtoolkitreadme)**: Allow users to pick up where they left off in a LearnDash course by clicking a button.
* **[Login/Logout Redirects](https://www.uncannyowl.com/knowledge-base/learndash-login-redirect/?utm_medium=ldtoolkitreadme)**: Redirect learners to a specific URL after signing in or out of the site.
