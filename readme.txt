The Uncanny LearnDash Toolkit adds the following features to your LearnDash site:

* **Front End Login**: Replace wp-login with a simple shortcode that you can drop onto any page to allow better branding of the login experience. User verification is also available to manage registrations.
* **Hide Admin Bar**: Hide the WordPress admin bar for any roles that you want.
* **LearnDash Resume Button**: Allow users to pick up where they left off in a LearnDash course by clicking a button.
* **LearnDash Groups in User Profiles**: Easily identify LearnDash Group membership from user profile pages.
* **Login Redirect**: Send learners to a custom dashboard or course after they sign in.
* **Menu Item Visibility**: Control the visibility of menu entries based on whether or not the user is signed in.
* **Show LearnDash Certificates**: Use a simple shortcode to display a list of all certificates (course and quiz) earned by the current user.
* **Show or Hide Content**: Use shortcodes to show or hide content based on whether or not a user is signed in. Great for Open course types.
* **Log In/Log Out Links**: Add Log In and Log Out links to menus, or to any page or widget with a shortcode.
* **LearnDash Breadcrumbs**: Add breadcrumb links that support courses, lessons, topics and quizzes. Also supports woocommerce, custom post types with or without taxonomies & tags, pages and blog posts.
