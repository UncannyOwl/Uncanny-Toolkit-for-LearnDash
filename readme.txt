This plugin extends LearnDash with a variety of optional functions that we find useful on typical LearnDash sites.

== Description ==
This plugin adds a variety of functions to LearnDash sites that help improve the learner experience and LearnDash development workflow. After building dozens of LearnDash platforms, we combined the functions that are common across LearnDash sites into this single plugin.

The current version of the Uncanny LearnDash Toolkit includes the following functions:

* Front End Login: Replace wp-login with a simple shortcode that you can drop onto any page to allow better branding of the login experience. User verification is also available to manage registrations.
* Hide Admin Bar: Hide the WordPress admin bar for any roles that you want.
* LearnDash Resume Button: Allow users to pick up where they left off in a LearnDash course by clicking a button.
* LearnDash Groups in User Profiles: Easily identify LearnDash Group membership from user profile pages.
* Login Redirect: Send learners to a custom dashboard or course after they sign in.
* Menu Item Visibility: Control the visibility of menu entries based on whether or not the user is signed in.
* Show LearnDash Certificates: Use a simple shortcode to display a list of all certificates (course and quiz) earned by the current user.
* Show or Hide Content: Use shortcodes to show or hide content based on whether or not a user is signed in. Great for Open course types.

If you are not using any of the functions in this plugin, please remember to turn them off to maximize performance.

Weâ€™ll continue adding features over the next few months. Breadcrumb shortcodes and printable learner transcripts are next on our list!
